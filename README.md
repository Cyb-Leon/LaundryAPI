## 📐 Use Case Stories

### **1. Auto-Scheduling Based on Usage Patterns**
- **As a user**: I want the system to automatically schedule my laundry tasks based on my past behavior so that I don't have to manually set laundry reminders.
- **Precondition**: The system has enough historical data about my laundry habits.
- **Outcome**: Laundry tasks are scheduled automatically, and I'm notified in advance.

### **2. Predictive Detergent Reordering**
- **As a user**: I want the system to predict when my detergent will run out and suggest reordering in time, so I never run out of supplies.
- **Precondition**: The system tracks my detergent usage and knows my current supply level.
- **Outcome**: I receive a notification suggesting when to reorder detergent, with a seamless ordering process.

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Behavioral Patterns**: LaundryAPI learns your habits over time, adapting its recommendations and schedules to fit your routine.
2. **Minimal Input**: After initial setup, the API requires minimal user input, automating most of the tasks involved in laundry management.
3. **Smart Notifications**: Stay informed with timely notifications for both laundry schedules and detergent reorders.

## 🛡️ Security & Privacy
